          <h1> Welcome to my Portfolio </h1>
          <h2> Communication, Advertising and Marketing Graduate and Coding Newbie </h2>
<p> Hi, and welcome to my portfolio! My journey into coding started in September 2020 after attending the CodeFirst Girls
  Introduction to Web Development course. Ever since then, I've been working on my own projects and collaboraing with teams 
to build up my portfolio and break into the technology industry and land myself a job in tech. You see, after completing my 
undergraduate degree in Communication, Advertising and Marketing, I realised I wanted to combine that knowledge with the skills
of web development and coding. I feel the two are a great match and my background in communication give me an advantage when 
building and designing tech. I'm 23 years
old and hoping to make a break into the industry. Below you will find my
social links, and you can <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> me at any
time. Feel free to look at my projects, and see my CV
<a href="#">here</a>. I appreciate the time you take to view my portfolio and if you have any questions, feel free to 
contact me.  </p>
